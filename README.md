# Project Athena

This project solely exists as a new standard for GTA:V roleplay servers on the [alt:V](https://altv.mp/) client. This features type safety through TypeScript and a solid foundation for what I consider the core of roleplay.

# Project Setup

Setup instructions may be purchased from Stuyk.

The code will remain open source for the forseeable future but support and how to utilize this project must be purchased.

Stuyk will not teach you how to add additional functionality to this gamemode. Only how to setup the project and get it running.
