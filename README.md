# Introduction

## Summary

This project solely exists as a new standard for GTA:V roleplay servers on the [alt:V](https://altv.mp/) client. The Athena Roleplay Script has type safety through TypeScript and a solid foundation for what is considered core for a Roleplay server. You can find a list of features for the Athena Roleplay Script below in the Feature List section.

Configuration files may be purchased from [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/products/SKpPN).

## Demo Server
