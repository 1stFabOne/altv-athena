# Project Athena

This project solely exists as a new standard for GTA:V roleplay servers on the [alt:V](https://altv.mp/) client. This features type safety through TypeScript and a solid foundation for what I consider the core of roleplay.

# Project Features

- Typescript
- Scaleable Folder Structure
- Character Editor
- Character Selection
- Discord oAuth2 Authentication

# Project Setup

Project setup will only be available through Stuyk when he is ready to let the gamemode recieve basic user testing.
